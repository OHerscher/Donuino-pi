# Donuino-pi
The goal of this project is to develop a flying drone powered by an arduino and a raspberry pi which can pass through defined waypoint.
At this point a program for arduino was developped which use a gps and a gyroscope/accelerometer module and a lcd screen for debug purpose.
The raspberry pi use python-serial and google maps api in order to get the position and represent it on a web page hosted by the raspberry.
The next thing to do is to program a data logger for gps position using sql.
All advices are welcome...
